# Hand Hygiene Observation Toolkit Handbook
The Explanatory Handbook for the Hand Hygiene Observation Tool

The Hand Hygiene Observation Toolkit (HHOT) enables users in the field to observe, record, analyse and share hand hygiene observations from medical facilities. The dashboard allows analysis of hand hygiene adherence across facilities, wards and staff groups. This information can inform decision-making and interventions at sites where hand hygiene can be improved.

The HHOT is based on the WHO **“5 Moments for Hand Hygiene”** approach: (http://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Hand_Hygiene_Why_How_and_When_Brochure.pdf)  
The HHOT measures adherence to the 5 moments in the following: 
* % before touching patient
* % before clean procedure 
* % after bodily fluid risk 
* % after touching patient 
* % after touching patient surroundings


The starter kit for **5 Moments** can be found at the following link: https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/tools/en/

This HHOT handbook explains how to collect data on the 5 moments of hand hygiene, and how to visualise it within the HHOT dashboard. 

The handbook takes you through seven phases:
1. How to create a KoBo Toolbox account
2. How to create Your Data Collection Form 
3. How to deploy Your Data Collection Form 
4. How to collect your data
5. How to download your data
6. How to input your data into the HHOT dashboard
7. How to analyse your data in the HHOT dashboard 

By the end of this process, you should have a working HHOT dashboard. [Here is a downloadable example of the dashboard using dummy data.](Example%20Folder/HHOT%20Dashboard%20Example.xlsb)

And, here is a screenshot of what the dashboard looks like when it is in use.

# Phase 1: How to create a KoBo Toolbox account

Objectives of step
* Create KoBo Toolbox account in order to collect data for input into HHOT.

Estimated time for task
* Two minutes.

1. [Click this link to go to Kobo Toolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/). 
2. Select sign-up, and then create either a Humanitarian Organizations or Researchers account - what follows will work with either.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions, including confirming the account by clicking the link sent to your email address. 

You have now created the platform for data collection. The next phase will be formatting a questionnaire for data collection. 

Please note: Kobo works best in Google Chrome, and you may be unable to use it in Internet Explorer or Firefox. 

# Phase 2: How to create Your Data Collection Form 

Objectives of step
* Correctly format your data collection form in preparation for uploading to Kobo. 

Estimated time for task
* This task requires formatting the data collection form provided, how much time it takes depends on the amount of edits made (so how many sites/facilities you wish to collect data on).

[Example Data Collection Form](Example%20Folder/Data%20Collection%20Form%20%20Example.xlsx). (Please note, when collecting a file from Github, you have the options to either 'view raw' or 'download' either option is in this situation works.)

The downloadable data collection form below is a generic version that can be adapted to your needs. It is currently formatted with generic names (eg: Department 1, Facility A), so you will need to edit these to reflect the facilities you wish to monitor. 


1. [Download the data collection form by clicking here.](Data%20Collection%20Form.xlsx)
2. Only edit the contents in the choices tab (the purple tab named **‘choices’**). Please do not edit the other tabs. When editing the choices tab, please note: only cells in column C should be edited. You must keep the format of the rest of the file when editing, otherwise the data you generate with Kobo will not be transferable into HHOT.
3. Add your department names (row 4-8 of column C). A department describes a group of facilities. If you have less than 4 departments, please delete the rows that are not needed. If you have more than four, please insert new rows below row 8.
4. Add your facility names (column C, row 9-34). Note that each facility relate to a specific department. In the example, department Montreal contains seven facilities on rows 7-13 and the form is colour coded to reflect this. Again, please delete any facility rows not used and insert new rows if you have more facilities than space. 
5. Save the form. Make sure to give it a distinct name. 
6. You are now ready to upload the form to Kobo Toolbox. 


# Phase 3: How to deploy Your Data Collection Form 
Please note: this is a data sharing tool, but has the option for data to remain private to the uploader. It is straightforward to ensure the data is visible to only you.

1. Open KoBo, and log into your account. 
2. Next select **new**, then **upload**, then **XLSform**. Upload your data collection form. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/2%20Upload%20XLSForm.png)
3. Once your data collection form is uploaded, **deploy** the form to make it active, and ready for data collection. 

# Phase 4: How to collect your data
1. Your data collectors will now be able to access and complete the data collection form. Your users have the option to log in (either through a browser or via the app, in which case they need your login details) or use the form's hyperlink. For this they do not need to log in, so it is a good option for those who do not have the app (it is not available on apple products). 
2. Your data collectors should use a new form fo each monitoring session. Provided the form has been formatted correctly it should be straightforward for them to fill in. Please ensure your data collectors put their own name in the name box and not the person they are observing. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/3%20deploy%20form.png)

*If you are having issues with this step* Double check you are using Google Chrome, this is the best browser to use for this. Try using the mobile app if you are using a hyperlink, or vice versa. You may also be having wifi connectivity issues. 

3. Once the form has started to be used, Kobo will generate a **‘data’** page for it. These will appear as individual forms with the names of the collectors.  
![](Screenshots%20folder/4%20example%20of%20form%20in%20use.png)
More information on form accessibility and use can be found here: (http://support.kobotoolbox.org/collecting-data/recommended-devices-for-data-collection) 


# Phase 5: How to download your data

Objectives of step
* To export your data from Kobo Toolkit into Excel in order to then input your data into HHOT.

Estimated time for task
* Two minutes, depending on dataset size and internet connectivity.

1. Once in your Kobo account click this, which takes you into the summary page of your form. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/5%20data%20section%20shown.png)
2. Select **'Data** at the top of the page 
![](Screenshots%20folder/6%20inside%20data%20section.png)
3. From the list on the left-hand side, select **'Downloads'**. 
4. In the **Download Data** criteria, make sure the **Export type** is **XLS** and Value and header format is **XML values and headers**. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/7%20downloading%20from%20kobo.png)
5. You are now ready to download your data. Depending on the size of your data and strength of wifi this may take a little time. 

For reference, an example of a downloaded Kobo data collection survey has been provided below.

# Phase 6: How to input your data into the HHOT dashboard

Objectives of step
* To input your data to the HHOT and thus visualise it. 

Estimated time for task
* 30+ minutes, depending on the size and type of your dataset. You may need to make many edits to the HHOT and therefore it will take you longer. A estimate is difficult in this context, but this is likely to be one  of the more lengthy steps in the process.

1. First open the HHOT dashboard: [HHOT Dashboard](HHOT%20Dashboard.xlsb)

If you are unable to see all tabs, please hit the icon with '...' in it at the bottom of the page, this will expand the tabs.

**RED TABS**: Data collected from the ODK form goes in these tabs. These tabs are called **‘Hand Hygiene Observation tool’** and **‘OBSERVATION_REPEAT’**. How to fill them with your data explained below. 

**GREY TABS**: These are calculation tabs of which there are two. 
* data_manipulated: **DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE** this is for calculations; it may provide a useful reference but please do not edit it as this will affect the tool.  
* lists: this page will need to be edited if you have changed the category/department/facility/ward names from the ODK form. How to do this is explained below. Please remember to ammend the first row titled 'CATEGORY' so it matches categories ammended at the survay editing phase.
* tables: this will generate once you have inputted criteria into the **‘analytics’**, please **DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE**  

**GREEN TAB**: This is the tab where the dashboard analytics will be displayed based on user criteria. How to use this is explained in Phase 7.
To use the analytics dashboard you will need to edit the following categories on this page:
* Date range 
* Desired criteria (your options are: Department/Dep_facility/Ward/Profession)
* Row labels 

Please Note: the ‘tables’ page will not generate data until you complete the criteria in ‘analytics’. You do not need to edit it, the formulas do that for you **PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE**

2. **Copy and paste** the data from your downloaded form into the red tabs **“Hand Hygiene Observation Tool”** and **“OBSERVATION_REPEAT”** in the same order as the ODK file export. (For the sake of clarity, this is your download from the Kobo toolkit; the data generated by your data survey.) 

* The first tab (which will be named as you have denoted when you uploaded the file to Kobo) must go into the tab **‘Hand Hygiene Observation Tool’**.
* The second tab called **‘OBSERVATION_REPEAT’** must go into the tab also called **‘OBSERVATION_REPEAT’** in the HHOT.
       
3. Edit the HHOT  **‘list’** page (the grey tab in the HHOT dashboard) 
4. Edit the department name to match the previous edits made for the data collection form. Similar to that process, the HHOT provided has generic names that must be edited to reflect what you wish to monitor. 

* Department names go under Column A and on Row 1.
* Facility names go under each respective Department column (in our example: Montreal Facilities are under Column B, London Facilities are under Column C, etc.) 

* Please delete any unwanted Department/Facility and add any extra Department/Facility. 

5. Ensure that **“ALL”** is present at the end of every column as a Facility choice. This will ensure that it is an option for you to measure if you wish. The formatting must be exactly like that in the provided example, and in the below screenshot. This inculdes the blank spaces. If you had more categories in your edited data collection form, then add those in but please remember to have your final collumn 'E' in this example, say **'ALL'** in both the first and second row.
![](/Screenshots%20folder/8%20ensuring%20'all'%20is%20there.png)
6. To adjust defined names, **select CTRL+F3** to open the Name Manager (or on Macs: ⌘ + fn + F3). By default, the generic departments are used for **"Defined Names"**.
7. Click on **“Edit”** to modify each applicable category.

* The **“Name”** column (DEPA, DEPB, DEPC, DEPD, DEPE) must be modified to reflect the same deparment names as on the **“lists”** tab (Montreal, London, Nairobi).

Please insure complete accuracy at this stage as a tiny change in any ammendedment will cause issues at later steps. This is likely one of the most difficult steps in this process so please be careful. 

# Phase 7: How to analyse your data in the HHOT dashboard
The visualisation element of HHOT takes place in the **"analytics"** tab, which you can format according to your needs. How to do this is explained below.
Please ensure that the Calculation Options are set to **“Automatic”**. Go to the Excel Ribbon.
![](https://github.com/MSF-UK/HHOT-Handbook/blob/master/Screenshots%20folder/9%20setting%20to%20automatic.png)

1. First input the dates that the observations started and stopped. Use this format: **day/month/year.** 
2. Enter the department, facility, ward and profession into the criteria table columns. This should be in a series of dropdown menus.  Then press refresh and the data analysis will be carried out for you. Adjust the criteria in the table, depending on what data you want to analyse, for example doctors handwashing hygiene in the burns ward of UCLH. 

If you are having issues at this step it is likely due to a issue with details. It may be that at the copy-paste step a detail was changed between documents. Please double check that the form was downloaded correctly from Kobo 

Here is a example of what a correct download looks like 
[Kobo Data Download Example](Example%20Folder/Kobo%20Data%20Download%20Example.xlsx)

Here is a example of what the HHOT fomatting looks like in use, it may be useful as a point of reference.
[Example HHOT tool](Example%20Folder/HHOT%20Dashboard%20Example.xlsb)

It could also be a issue with the changes made to the 'lists' page, please double check that the changes made match those made earlier to the data collection form. 

3. Next refresh the page and go to the pivot table on the left hand side of the page. Turn the option to **“true”** for date range. 
4. Then, ensure the pivot table is accurate. The **'Row Lables'** should match the **'Departments'** that you have selected in the **'Desired Criteria'** section. Double click the drop down under **'Row Lables'** to generate the options availible. 

If this is proving difficult, refresh the page again. 

Here is a step by step guide on how to referesh a pivot table. (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/refresh-pivottable-data-6d24cece-a038-468a-8176-8b6568ca9be2)


If you are having issues with this step it may be that the chagnes made to the 'lists' page are still inconsistant with your data download from Kobo, please double check this.
