# HHOT-Handbook-
A Handbook to the Hand Hygiene Observation Tool

The Hand Hygiene Observation Tool enables users in the field to observe, record and share hand hygiene observations from medical facilities. A dashboard will allow analysis of data from across sites, providing information on hand hygiene compliance at facility and ward level. This information will inform decision-making and interventions at sites where hand hygiene can be improved.

The HHOT is based on the WHO “My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene” approach: (http://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Hand_Hygiene_Why_How_and_When_Brochure.pdf)  
The HHOT measures the  5 moments adherence in the following: 
* % before touching patient
* % before clean procedure 
* % after body fluid risk 
* % after touching patient 
* % after soundings 
The starter kit for this campaign can be found at the below link. Please click it for the survey form that informed the creation of the HHOT tool, self assessment, 5 moments of cleanliness poster among other resources that may be useful to you.

This guide explains how to collect data on the five points of hand cleanliness, and how to format this within the HHOT tool and visualize your data. 

The first step is to create a Kobo Toolbox account, this will be where you collect your data. You then must customise the provided data collection survay to reflect your medical facility, upload this to Kobo and your data collectors will use this online form to gather information. The data will then be downloaded from Kobo and inputed into HHOT. 
This guide explains fully how to accomplish each of these steps.

# Phase 1: -How to create a KoBo account- 

Objectives of step
* *Create KoBo toolbox account in order to collect data for input into HHOT.*

Estimated time for task
* *Two minutes.*

1. Follow this link: (https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) For more information about Kobo please click here.
2. Click sign-up, either account type (Humanitarian Organizations or Researchers) works. Please bear in mind, if you wish your observers to be able to use the account your login details should be simple. You also have the option for observers to use a hyperlink to the questionnaire so if they log-in to Kobo or not is up to your discretion.  
3. Follow on screen instructions, for those encouraging users to fill in the form using the KoBo app, create a generic login which everyone can access. 

You have now created the platform for data collection. The next phase will be formatting a questionnaire for data collection. 

# Phase 2: -Create Your Data Collection Form- 

The ODK form provided is a generic survey that must be adapted to the needs of the user. ODK is its technical name but for the sake of simplicity it is going to be referred to as a ‘data collection form’ as this is its purpose. The data collection form is currently formatted with general names (eg: Department 1, Facility A) you must edit these to reflect the sites you wish to monitor. 

Following the correct formatting of your data within the provided data collection form, you will then need to upload your survey to Kobo. You must keep the format of when editing, otherwise the data you generate with Kobo will not be transferable into HHOT. 

Objectives of step
* Correctly format your data collection form in preparation for uploading to Kobo. 
Estimated time for task
* This task requires formatting the data collection  form provided, how much time it takes depends on the amount of edits made (so how many sites/facilities you wish to collect data on). 

1. First download the data collection form by following this link: 

[Data Collection Form](HHOT-Handbook/blob/master/Data%20Collection%20Form.xlsx)

2. Next, edit the content in the choices tab (This is the purple tab named ‘choices’, please do not edit the other tabs).

When editing your form, please note: *only cells in column C should have been edited. The instructions below go into more detail as to to how to edit the data collection form.* 

3. Edit according to your department names. (row 4-8 of column C).
4. Edit according to your facility names. (column C, row 9-34). Please bear in mind that the facilities relate to the department. In our example department UCLH contains facilities from A- G, and the form is colour coded to reflect this. For C5 it isH -K, C6 L-M, C7 N-R and C8 S-Z.  Please delete any rows not used. 
5. Save the form. 
6. You are now ready to upload the form to Kobo. 

# Phase 3: -Deploy Your Data Collection Form- 
Please note; *this is a data sharing tool but has the option for data to remain private to the uploader, and it is straightforward how to ensure the data is visible to only you.*

1. Open KoBo, and log into your account 
2. Next press new, then upload, and select XLSform. Upload your saved data collection form.

3. The data collection form should now be uploaded, now lets press deploy the form, this makes the form active, and ready to collect data.

# Phase 4: -Collecting Your Data-
1. Your data collectors will now be able to access it and complete the data collection form. Your users have the option to either log in (either online or via the app, in which case they need your login details) or use the form hyperlink. For this they do not login and it is a good option for those who do not have the app (it is not available on apple products). 
2. Your data collectors should use a new form per monitoring session. Provided the form has been formatted correctly it should be straightforward for them to fill in the form.

3. Once the form has started to be used, Kobo will generate a ‘data’ page these will appear as individual forms with the names of the collectors.

# Phase 5: -Downloading Your Data-
Objectives of step
* *To export your data from KBT into excel in order ot then input your data into HHOT.* 

Estimated time for task
* *Two minutes, depends on dataset size and speed of wifi.*

1. Once in your KoBo account you willthis takes you into the summary page of your form.

2. Click the data button which is at the top of the page 
![](Screenshots%20folder/6%20inside%20data%20section.png)
3. On the left hand side of the data page you are now on there is a downloads button. In the Download Data criteria, make sure the Export type is XLS and Value and header format is XML values and headers.

4. Download this, depending on the size of your data and strength of wifi this may take a little time.
