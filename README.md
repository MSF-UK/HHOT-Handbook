# -Hand Hygiene Observation Tool Handbook-
*The Explanatory Handbook for the Hand Hygiene Observation Tool*

The Hand Hygiene Observation Tool enables users in the field to observe, record and share hand hygiene observations from medical facilities. A dashboard will allow analysis of data from across sites, providing information on hand hygiene compliance at facility and ward level. This information will inform decision-making and interventions at sites where hand hygiene can be improved.

The HHOT is based on the WHO **“5 Moments for Hand Hygiene”** approach: (http://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Hand_Hygiene_Why_How_and_When_Brochure.pdf)  
The HHOT measures the  5 moments adherence in the following: 
* % before touching patient
* % before clean procedure 
* % after body fluid risk 
* % after touching patient 
* % after soundings 
The starter kit for this campaign can be found at the below link. Please click it for the survey form that informed the creation of the HHOT tool, self assessment, 5 moments of cleanliness poster among other resources that may be useful to you. 
(https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/tools/en/) 

This guide explains how to collect data on the five points of hand cleanliness, and how to format this within the HHOT tool and visualize your data. 

The first step is to create a Kobo Toolbox account, this will be where you collect your data. You then must customise the provided data collection survay to reflect your medical facility, upload this to Kobo and your data collectors will use this online form to gather information. The data will then be downloaded from Kobo and inputed into HHOT. 
This guide explains fully how to accomplish each of these steps.

# Phase 1: -How to create a KoBo account- 

Objectives of step
* *Create KoBo toolbox account in order to collect data for input into HHOT.*

Estimated time for task
* *Two minutes.*

1. Follow this link: (https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) For more information about Kobo please click here.
2. Click sign-up, either account type (Humanitarian Organizations or Researchers) works. Please bear in mind, if you wish your observers to be able to use the account your login details should be simple. You also have the option for observers to use a hyperlink to the questionnaire so if they log-in to Kobo or not is up to your discretion.  
3. Follow on screen instructions, for those encouraging users to fill in the form using the KoBo app, create a generic login which everyone can access. 

You have now created the platform for data collection. The next phase will be formatting a questionnaire for data collection. 

Please note: *Kobo works best in Google Chrome, you may be unable to use it in Internet Explorer or Firefox.* 

# Phase 2: -Create Your Data Collection Form- 

The ODK form provided is a generic survey that must be adapted to the needs of the user. ODK is its technical name but for the sake of simplicity it is going to be referred to as a **‘data collection form’** as this is its purpose. The data collection form is currently formatted with general names (eg: Department 1, Facility A) you must edit these to reflect the sites you wish to monitor. 

Following the correct formatting of your data within the provided data collection form, you will then need to upload your survey to Kobo. You must keep the format of when editing, otherwise the data you generate with Kobo will not be transferable into HHOT. 


Objectives of step
* *Correctly format your data collection form in preparation for uploading to Kobo.* 

Estimated time for task
* *This task requires formatting the data collection  form provided, how much time it takes depends on the amount of edits made (so how many sites/facilities you wish to collect data on).* 


1. First download the data collection form by following this link: 

[Data Collection Form](Data%20Collection%20Form.xlsx)

2. Next, edit the content in the choices tab (This is the purple tab named **‘choices’**, please do not edit the other tabs).

When editing your form, please note: *only cells in column C should have been edited. The instructions below go into more detail as to to how to edit the data collection form.* 

3. Edit according to your department names. (row 4-8 of column C).
4. Edit according to your facility names. (column C, row 9-34). Please bear in mind that the facilities relate to the department. In the example department UCLH contains facilities from A- G, and the form is colour coded to reflect this. For C5 it isH -K, C6 L-M, C7 N-R and C8 S-Z.  Please delete any rows not used. 
5. Save the form. 
6. You are now ready to upload the form to Kobo. 

For a point of reference, a example of a edited data collection form is provided below. 

[Example Data Collection Form](Example%20Folder/Data%20Collection%20Form%20%20Example.xlsx)

# Phase 3: -Deploy Your Data Collection Form- 
Please note; *this is a data sharing tool but has the option for data to remain private to the uploader, and it is straightforward how to ensure the data is visible to only you.*

1. Open KoBo, and log into your account 
2. Next press **new**, then **upload**, and select **XLSform**. Upload your data collection form. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/2%20Upload%20XLSForm.png)
3. The data collection form is now uploaded, now click **deploy** the form, this makes the form active, and ready to collect data. 

# Phase 4: -Collecting Your Data-
1. Your data collectors will now be able to access it and complete the data collection form. Your users have the option to either log in (either online or via the app, in which case they need your login details) or use the form hyperlink. For this they do not login and it is a good option for those who do not have the app (it is not available on apple products). 
2. Your data collectors should use a new form per monitoring session. Provided the form has been formatted correctly it should be straightforward for them to fill in the form. Please ensure your data collectors put their own name down in the name box and not the person they are observing. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/3%20deploy%20form.png)

*If you are having issues with this step* Double check you are using Google Chrome, this is the best engine to use for this. Try using the mobile app if you are using a hyperlink, or vice versa. You may also be having wifi connectivity issues. 

3. Once the form has started to be used, Kobo will generate a **‘data’** page these will appear as individual forms with the names of the collectors.  
![](Screenshots%20folder/4%20example%20of%20form%20in%20use.png)

# Phase 5: -Downloading Your Data-

Objectives of step
* *To export your data from KBT into excel in order ot then input your data into HHOT.* 

Estimated time for task
* *Two minutes, depends on dataset size and speed of wifi.*

1. Once in your KoBo account click this, which takes you into the summary page of your form. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/5%20data%20section%20shown.png)
2. Click the data button which is at the top of the page 
![](Screenshots%20folder/6%20inside%20data%20section.png)
3. On the left hand side of the data page you are now on there is a downloads button. In the **Download Data** criteria, make sure the **Export type** is **XLS** and Value and header format is **XML values and headers**. 
![](Screenshots%20folder/7%20downloading%20from%20kobo.png)
4. Download this, depending on the size of your data and strength of wifi this may take a little time. 

For reference, a example of a downloaded Kobo data collection survay has been provided below.

# Phase 6: -Inputting your data from Kobo into HHOT-

Objectives of step
* *To input your data to the HHOT tool and thus visualise it.*  

Estimated time for task
* *30+ minutes, although this will depend on the size and type of your dataset. You may need to make many edits to the HHOT tool and therefore it will take you longer. A estimate is difficult in this context, but this is likely to be one  of the more lengthy steps in this process.*

1. First open the HHOT dashboard by following this link:

[HHOT Dashboard](HHOT%20Dashboard.xlsb)

**RED TABS**: Data collected from the ODK form goes in these tabs. These tabs are called **‘Hand Hygiene Observation tool’** and **‘OBSERVATION_REPEAT’** how to fill them with your data from KoBo is explained below. 

**GREY TABS**: These are calculation tabs of which there are two. 
* data_manipulated: **DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE** this is for calculations, it may provide a useful reference but please do not edit it as this will affect the tool.  
* lists: this page will need to be edited if you have changed the category/ department/facility/ward names from the ODK form. How to do this is explained below. 
* tables: this will generate once you have inputted criteria into the **‘analytics’**, please **DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE**  

**GREEN TAB**: This is the tab where the dashboard analytics will be displayed based on user criteria. Using this is expalined later.
To use the tool you will need to edit this page under the following categories 
* Date range 
* Desired criteria (your options are:Department/Dep_facility/Ward/Profession)
* Row labels 

Please Note: *the ‘tables’ page will not generate data until you edit criteria in ‘analytics’ you do not need to edit it, the formulas do that for you **PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE**

2. You must **Copy&paste** the data from your downloaded form into the red tabs **“Hand Hygiene Observation Tool”** and **“OBSERVATION_REPEAT”** in the same order as the ODK file export (For the sake of clarity, this is your download from Kobo tools, the data generated by your data survay) 

* The first tab (which will be named as you have denoted when you uploaded the file to KoBo) must go into the tab **‘Hand Hygiene Observation Tool’** (one of the red tabs)
* The second tab called **‘OBSERVATION_REPEAT’** must go into the tab also called **‘OBSERVATION_REPEAT’** in the HHOT.
       
3. Now edit the HHOT  **‘list’** page (it is a grey tab in the HHOT dashboard) 
4. Edit the department name to match the previous edits made for the data collection form. Similar to that process, the HHOT provided has generic names that must be edited to reflect what you wish to monitor. 

* Department names go under Column A and on Row 1.
* Facility names go under each respective Department column (example: Montreal Facilities are under Column B, London Facilities are under Column C, etc.) 
* Please delete any unwanted Department/Facility and add any extra Department/Facility.

5. Ensure that **“ALL”** is present at the end of every column as a Facility choice, this will ensure that this is a option for you to measure if you wish. 
![](/Screenshots%20folder/8%20ensuring%20'all'%20is%20there.png)
6. To adjust defined names, **Hit CTRL+F3** to open the Name Manager, (or on Macs. ⌘ + fn + F3) By default, the generic departments are used for **"Defined Names"**.
7. Click on **“Edit”** to modify each applicable category

* The **“Name”** column (DEPA, DEPB, DEPC, DEPD, DEPE) must be modified to reflect the same 
* Deparment Names as on the **“lists”** tab (ie. Montreal, London and Nairobi).

# Phase 7 : -Analysing your data in HHOT-
The visualisation element of HHOT takes place in the **"analytics"** tab. You must format this according to your needs. How to do this is explained below.
Please ensure that the Calculation Options are set to **“Automatic”**. Go to Excel Ribbon.
![](https://github.com/MSF-UK/HHOT-Handbook/blob/master/Screenshots%20folder/9%20setting%20to%20automatic.png)

1. First input the dates that the observations started, and stopped. Use this format: **day/month/year.** 
2. Next refresh the page, and go to the pivot table on the left hand side of the page, and turn the option to **“true”** for date range. If this is proving difficult, refresh the page again. 
3. Enter the department, facility, ward and profession; into the criteria table columns. This should be in a series of drop down menus.  Then press refresh and the data analysis will be carried out for you. Adjust the criteria in the table, depending on what data you want to analyse, for example doctors handwashing hygiene in the burns ward of UCLH.
